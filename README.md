# WoTRippr
World of Tanks game file management tool. Includes Replay and Mod deletion.

# ATTENTION
This project will be moving to a new repo in the future to bring it added functionality, ease of use, and generally more Aesthetic Appeal (TM)
This new repo will, while it can be considered WoTRipper 3.0, be renamed to WoTScythe, as the GUI version of WoTRipper.
WoTRipper will no longer be updated, and all development will be going into WoTScythe. The same tool, just prettier and easier to use.
This repo will be left up as a legacy edition.
